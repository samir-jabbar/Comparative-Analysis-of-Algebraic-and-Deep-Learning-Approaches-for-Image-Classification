## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of the performance of two distinct approaches for image classification: algebraic and deep learning methods. This research explores and evaluates the efficacy of these techniques in image classification tasks.

### Algebraic Approach
The algebraic approach in this project primarily involves the utilization of classical techniques, including Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and other linear algebra methods. These methods aim to extract essential features from the image data and make predictions based on algebraic computations.

### Deep Learning Approach
The deep learning approach focuses on employing state-of-the-art techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are designed to automatically learn and extract hierarchical features from raw image data, enabling accurate image classification.

This project seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, highlighting scenarios where one might outperform the other.
